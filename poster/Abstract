Abstract (300 words / 300 words):
Within-sample viral diversity in metagenomic viromes can serve as a bioindicator of host immune state and infection risk. Traditional indices (Shannon, Simpson, Hill numbers) capture heterogeneity and abundance but ignore evolutionary distance, while phylogenetic indices such as Faith’s PD disregard relative abundance, masking differences between near-clonal expansions and distinct lineages. We present a reproducible benchmarking framework based on Rao’s quadratic diversity (Rao’s Q) as a phylogenetically informed -diversity metric for viromes, characterizing behavior, reproducibility, and interpretability in clinical metagenomic samples.
Using controlled plasma viromes with a constant background and serial dilutions of bacteriophage M13mp18 (1.4 × 102 – 4.3 × 106 copies/mL), Rao’s Q increased linearly with lineage depletion (slope: 0.003 per log10 copies/mL; 95% CI: -0.0003 – 0.0056). In silico perturbations confirmed that ΔRao’s Q scales with phylogenetic distance (R2 = 0.98) and is robust to read cross-mapping and tree-collapsing operations. Across seven Oxford Nanopore runs of Anelloviridae, Rao’s Q showed high reproducibility (within-run CV = 0.026; between-run CV = 0.118; median ρ = 0.70), defining empirical thresholds serving as quantitative performance benchmarks for evolutionary diversity metrics. Two negative-control dilution series, spanning a 104-fold range in input, confirmed bounded variability (CV ≤ 0.05).
In patient plasma viromes (n = 92), Rao’s Q ranged from 0.00 – 0.30 (median = 0.17), exceeding technical variability and revealing evolutionary dispersion undetected by abundance-only indices. By integrating phylogeny and abundance, Rao’s Q quantifies -diversity as evolutionary dispersion. In viral metagenomes, where closely related genomes generate extensive read cross-mapping and inflate apparent homogeneity, this framework distinguishes evolutionary heterogeneity from mapping artifacts. Rao’s Q provides a quantitative and reproducible measure of within-sample diversity that remains stable across sequencing runs and is sensitive to genuine lineage turnover. Beyond viromes, this distance-based formalism generalizes to other genomic systems, enabling standardized diversity comparisons across microbiomes, plasmidomes, and pangenomes.
